Let the quarrel on template formats end, let us bring joy to development.

This project aims for the integration of multiple templating formats, whilst
maintaining a focus on content, such as common API for all.

The second focus is simplicity and avoid bloat. It's not for those who want a
out of the box solution for your needs, but for those for a need for speed, and
focus on what matters.
